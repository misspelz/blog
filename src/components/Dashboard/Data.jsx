    description:
      "The digital twin concept – whereby technology is used to copy a physical product, process, or service – has been around for decades but has taken on more importance recently as Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly used to pair the virtual and real worlds. The approach is being applied across various interesting and important use cases, from the retail industry tracking and tracing products along the supply chain to the automotive industry planning advanced vehicle systems seen in modern connected cars. The development of digital twins also gives rise to the adoption of ‘virtual prototyping’, bringing unprecedented visibility into businesses’ assets and production. This allows real-world companies to reinvent products and processes with all the power and flexibility of today’s digital technologies.Sitting at the heart of more of these innovative trends are IoT devices, which provide real-time data collected from physical objects – and are then used to produce simulations and predictions to optimise components, processes, and systems. By combining IoT with digital twinning, organisations can leverage real-world data into a continuous, seamless, creative process. ",
